==================

I'm taking a leave of absence from school to pursue web development for a year, so I might use my github page as a blog for friends and family to see what I'm up to. 

For now, this is THE MOST BASIC landing page that I wrote at the beginning of the summer for the YFilm project I would later undertake. I gave it a shot! Visit https://github.com/jdmcpeek/yfilm.git to see the next iteration of YFilm, created three months later.
